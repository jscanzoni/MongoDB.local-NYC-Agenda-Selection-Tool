This talk explores how to transform reactive LLM applications into genuinely intelligent agents through sophisticated memory engineering.We'll establish the framework distinguishing LLM memory (parametric weights and context windows) from Agent Memory (persistent external systems), examining how data transforms into actionable memory through aggregation, encoding, storage, organization, and retrieval. The presentation details key memory types—episodic, semantic, procedural, and associative—and their roles in agent architectures.Through technical visualizations, we'll explore diverse memory implementations: short-term components (working memory, semantic cache) for immediate task optimization, and long-term structures for accumulated knowledge. The session covers practical patterns including workflow memory for reusable procedures, toolbox memory for dynamic tool discovery, conversational memory for relationship continuity, and persona memory for consistent behavior.We'll dive into the supporting search infrastructure—lexical, vector, and hybrid approaches—plus critical preprocessing like document chunking strategies. The talk includes an overview of how MongoDB serves as a unified memory provider for agentic systems, eliminating the need for multiple specialized databases while providing the multi-model retrieval, flexible storage, and optimization features essential for production deployments.Drawing from production deployments, we'll address often-overlooked challenges: memory conflicts, scaling to millions of units, compression strategies, and system economics.

In this new world where prompts, retrieval, tools, and memory collide — systems break in subtle, hard-to-predict ways. This talk introduces a modern observability framework built for agent-based systems. It’s a practical, metric-driven approach to catching and correcting failure modes early—by deeply instrumenting the agent loop across tool quality, error rates, latencies, and business KPIs. We walk through a real-world agent powering a stock-trading workflow, showing how brittle retrieval and flawed logic lead to drift—and how improved telemetry enables fast, targeted fixes. Attendees will leave with a new playbook for GenAI reliability: how to layer in observability with minimal lift, trace root causes, and drive continuous improvement with hard metrics.",
